// This set of task is based on you creating functions which
// does something. Each task will be it's own function
// They are already hooked up to a set of buttons which
// you can click and have the function execute.

// ===============================
// Task 1: Understanding Datatypes
// ===============================

// Boolean Practice
// Create a variable named isRaining and assign it the value true.
// Use console.log to print a message like "It's raining!" if isRaining is true, otherwise print "It's not raining."
function task1() {}

// Numbers Practice
// Create a variable named age and assign it any number.
// Print the value of age multiplied by 2.
// Create another variable called pi and set its value to 3.14159. Multiply pi by 2 and print the result.
function task2() {}

// Strings Practice
// Create two string variables firstName and lastName.
// Concatenate both strings into a single variable called fullName and print it to the console.
function task3() {}

// Arrays Practice
// Create an array called fruits with the values ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].
// Add another fruit to the array and print the updated array.
// Print the first and last item from the array.
function task4() {}

// Objects Practice
// Create an object called car with the properties brand, model, and year.
// Print out the car's brand and year using dot notation.
function task5() {}

// =========================
// Task 2: Using While Loops
// =========================

// Basic Counting with While Loops
// Write a while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.
function task6() {}

// Looping Over Arrays
// Use a while loop to iterate over the fruits array (from Task 1) and print each fruit.
function task7() {}

// Sum of Even Numbers
// Write a while loop that calculates the sum of even numbers between 1 and 20, then print the result.
function task8() {}

// =================================
// Task 3: Introduction to Functions
// =================================

// These you'll have to write yourself, as well as link them up

// Function to Print a Message
// Write a function called sayHello that prints the message "Hello, world!" when called.

// Function to Print All Fruits
// Write a function named printFruits that loops through the fruits array (from Task 1) and prints each fruit.

// Function to Count from 1 to N
// Write a function called countToTen that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

// Sum of an Array Using a Function
// Write a function called sumArray that sums all the numbers in an array and prints the result.
// Test it by passing an array like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
// Extra Challenge (Optional)
// Reversing an Array

// Write a function called reverseArray that takes an array and prints its elements in reverse order using a while loop.

// Creating an Object with a Function
// Write a function called createPerson that creates an object with name, age, and gender properties, and prints the object.
